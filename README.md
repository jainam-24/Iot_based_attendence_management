# Iot_based_attendence_management

The project uses the RFID technology to take the attendence.
 
Components used: 
-esp8266 as the microcontroller
-RFID module 
-jumper wires
-multiple RFID tags

TO implement the following project:
1) Dump the arduino c code into esp8266/esp32
2) Connect the esp8266 with any hotspot for providing wifi connectivity
3) SPI communication protocol is used between esp8266 and rfid module.
4) Make the required connections between them on breadboard.
5) After setting the baud rate, close the arduino ide and open excel sheet with dedicated macro in it.
6) Allow for macro in excel and then scan the rfid tags on rfid module.
7) Database of students along with their credentials will be recorded in excel sheet.
